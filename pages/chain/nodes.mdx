# Node

An AvalancheGo node is a key element of the Avalanche blockchain network, maintaining a copy of the distributed ledger and validating transactions. Utilizing the innovative Avalanche consensus protocol, these nodes ensure swift transaction finalization and robust security. They are designed to be user-friendly and versatile, accommodating users with various technical knowledge levels and enabling developers to create unique blockchain applications.
