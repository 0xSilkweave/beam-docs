# Requirements to run a Validator

## Hardware Requirements
Avalanche is an incredibly lightweight protocol, so nodes can run on commodity hardware with the following minimum specifications. 

- **CPU:** Equivalent of 8 AWS vCPU
- **RAM:** 16 GiB
- **Storage:** 1 TiB
- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 or MacOS >= 12
- **Network:** sustained 5Mbps up/down bandwidth

The node should be configured to accept incoming TCP/IP connections on port`9651`.

<Callout type="info">
  HW requirements shall scale with the amount of AVAX staked on the node and/or network activity. Nodes with big stakes (100k+ AVAX) will need more powerful machines than listed, and will use more bandwidth as well.
</Callout>

## Stake Requirements

In addition to the hardware, running a validator on Beam requires holding a minimum amount of AVAX and MC tokens. Specifically, you'll need at least **2000 AVAX** tokens and ***tbd*** MC.

The AVAX tokens need to be staked for a minimum period of **2 weeks** and a maximum of **1 year**.


## Next Steps

If you are sure to meet all the requirments you can now go ahead and [add your node as a validator](/chain/nodes/validator).
