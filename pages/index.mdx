## Meet Beam

Beam is a sovereign network focused on gaming brought to you by the Merit Circle DAO. Powered by the established Avalanche network, Beam operates independently to cater  towards  gamers and game developers.

-   **Empowered by the Merit Circle DAO:** Empowered by the established decentralized autonomous organization, Beam enjoys the support of a passionate community of gaming enthusiasts. With a strong network of more than 60 partnered games, dozens of contributors, developers, tools and investors, the DAO’s ecosystem provides confidence and instant utility.
-   **Quick, simple and minimal fees:**  The Avalanche network ensures all subnets enjoy minimal fees and quick settlement without jeopardizing security through allowing their own configuration. Having the ability to adjust base fees and block time allows for optimization for transactions in games. One example here is the DFK subnet supporting DeFi Kingdom with 1.5 million transactions every single day for the past months with negligible fees for its users.
-   **Seamless deployment:** Beam allows game developers to deploy their games on-chain seamlessly. Everything from smart contracts to gas-optimized transactions, asset management, oracles for web2 games and marketplaces can be provided on Beam, letting developers focus on their games.
-   **Trusted and vetted:** Users can enjoy safe decentralized and autonomous applications by trusted developers allowing them to seamlessly move across the network. Initially, only whitelisted addresses can deploy new smart contracts to the subnet. To make this process happen in a fair and open way, token holders may propose what address(es) Beam allows.


## Games, infrastructure and more games.

You would have no reason to visit a grocery store without products or a carnival without attractions. With blockchains, it’s no different. To have a proper functioning network, you need decentralized applications using the network. From day one, Beam will launch with a wide range of products and games.

Proudly, we’re able to share that Beam will be home to titles like Trial Xtreme, Walker World, Hash Rush, Sphere and Edenhorde Eclipse. Besides that, there will be products such as an AMM and a wide range of infrastructural products. Do note that these games will not be live on day one of Beam, as we are dependent on their timelines.

Dive in below to find out more about the games and products confirmed to launch on Beam.
