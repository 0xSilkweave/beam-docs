# Verifying Contracts

To verify a contract on the official explorer, use the [Verifying Contracts Tool](https://subnets.avax.network/tools/verify-contract) at avax.network.

The process simply requires you to select **Beam** as the subnet, fill in the **contract address** of the contract you wish to verify, and, as the final step, **select all your contract files** for upload. After all the files are uploaded, start the verification by clicking on **Submit Verification**.
