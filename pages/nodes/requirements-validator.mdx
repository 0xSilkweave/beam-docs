# Requirements to run a Validator

## Hardware Requirements
Avalanche is an incredibly lightweight protocol, so nodes can run on commodity hardware with the following minimum specifications. ***tbd: this are the requirments for the primary network (X,P, and C chain), we might have to increase them for beam?***

- CPU: Equivalent of 8 AWS vCPU
- RAM: 16 GiB
- Storage: 1 TiB
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 or MacOS >= 12
- Network: sustained 5Mbps up/down bandwidth

***tbd: add a warning/notice for traffic usage of validators?***



<Callout type="info">
  HW requirements shall scale with the amount of AVAX staked on the node and/or network activity. Nodes with big stakes (100k+ AVAX) will need more powerful machines than listed, and will use more bandwidth as well.
</Callout>

## Token Requirements

In addition to the hardware, running a validator on Beam requires holding a minimum amount of tokens. Specifically, you'll need at least **2000 AVAX** tokens and ***tbd*** MC.
