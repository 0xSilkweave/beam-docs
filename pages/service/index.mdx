# Getting started

To get started, obtain your API key for Beam by requesting it through beam@meritcircle.io. Then, read about how to make requests using our HTTP API or dedicated server side SDKs. We provide with numerous guides within this documentation on how to consume Beam
 
<Steps>
### Step 1
 
Obtain your API key. If you haven't received any API key yet, please contact beam@meritcircle.io.
 
### Step 2
 
Pick an implementation strategy. You can either connect to the HTTP API directly, or use one of our provided SDKs. We currently provide a [Node.js (Typescript)](https://github.com/Merit-Circle/beam-node), and [C#](https://github.com/Merit-Circle/beam-csharp) SDK, but are happy to provide you with a client based on whatever language you need to support

### Step 3

Implement Beam in your backend. Get started with one of our guides or choose a strategy of your own. We recommend you to get familiar with the terminology in Beam, starting with [Profiles](/service/profiles)
